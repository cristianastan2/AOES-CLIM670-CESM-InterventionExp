## Intevention Experiments

Experiments where you `intervene` in the model in some way to force a particular type of behavior and then see how the simulation evolves.

### Challenges
* Model does not respond well to big changes, so these have to be handled carefully
* Model behavior may be unphysical depending on the type of change imposed.

### Example: Added Heating Experiments

These experiments nudge the model towards a specific atmospheric heating profile.

Explain how they (and nudging) works.
